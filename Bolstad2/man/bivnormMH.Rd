\title{Metropolis Hastings sampling from a Bivariate Normal distribution}
\usage{
bivnormMH(rho, rho1 = 0.9, sigma = c(1.2, 1.2), steps = 1000, type = "ind")
}
\arguments{
\item{rho}{the correlation coefficient for the bivariate normal}

\item{rho1}{the correlation of the candidate distribution. Only used when
type = 'ind'}

\item{sigma}{the standard deviations of the marginal distributions of the
independent candidate density. Only used when type = 'ind'}

\item{steps}{the number of Metropolis Hastings steps}

\item{type}{the type of candidate generation to use. Can be one of 'rw' =
random walk, 'ind' = independent normals, 'gibbs' = Gibbs sampling or
'block' = blockwise. It is sufficient to use 'r','i','g', or 'b'}
}
\value{
returns a list which contains a data frame called targetSample with
members x and y. These are the samples from the target density.
}
\description{
This function uses the MetropolisHastings algorithm to draw a sample from a
correlated bivariate normal target density using a random walk candidate and
an independent candidate density respectively where we are drawing both
parameters in a single draw. It can also use the blockwise Metropolis
Hastings algorithm and Gibbs sampling respectively to draw a sample from the
correlated bivariate normal target.
